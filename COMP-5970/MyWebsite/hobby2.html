<H3>Valorant</H3>
Valorant is a 5v5 tactical shooter by Riot Games where precise aim and team strategy determine the outcome.
I have been playing competitively since the game launched and at my peak I was ranked in the top 0.1% of players in North America.

<H3>Auburn University Varsity Team</H3>
I was a member of Auburn University's Valorant varsity esports team.
Competing at the collegiate level meant regular scrimmages, organized team practice, and tournaments against other universities across the country.
It was a great experience combining my love of the game with representing Auburn.

<UL>
